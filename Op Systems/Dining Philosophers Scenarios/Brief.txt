Use Promela to model variations of the Dining Phisophers problem and use SPIN to prove certain properties:

Model a situation where there is only one philosopher at the table. Prove that no deadlock, starvation or livelock occurs.
Prove that with two philosophers who are not seated beside one another, no deadlock, starvation or livelock occurs.
Prove that deadlock can occur if just two philosophers are present, but seated beside one another.
Prove that deadlock can occur with four philosophers.
Prove that it is possible to solve the deadlock problem in all cases, but that livelock and starvation are possible.
